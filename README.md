# ðŸ“š JAVA-DSA: Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

This repository serves as a personal collection and practice ground for solving common Data Structures and Algorithms problems using the Java programming language. The goal is to build a robust, well-tested, and clean set of solutions organized by topic.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

All code is organized into dedicated folders by DSA topic to ensure easy navigation and study.
1.Sorting Techniques
2.2D Arrays
3.Strings
4.Bit Manipulation
5.Object oriented programming in java
6.Recursion
7.Divide and Conquer
8.Backtracking
9.ArrayLists
10.Linked Lists
11.Stacks
12.Queues
13.Greedy Algorithm
14.Binary Trees

## ðŸš€ Getting Started (How to Run the Code)

1.  *Clone the Repository:*
    bash
    git clone [https://github.com/vedikapawar19/JAVA-DSA.git](https://github.com/vedikapawar19/JAVA-DSA.git)
    cd JAVA-DSA
    

2.  *Navigate to the File:*
    bash
    cd SortingTechniques
    

3.  *Compile the Java File:*
    bash
    javac SelectionSort.java
    

4.  *Run the Compiled Class:*
    bash
    java SelectionSort
    

## âš  Note on File Types

This repository is primarily for .java source code. Compiled .class files are often ignored using a .gitignore file to keep the repository clean.



Happy Coding! Feel free to explore the implementations.
